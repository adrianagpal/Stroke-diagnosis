# Data preparation of stroke dataset and trying ML models to predict probability of stroke

This project explores predicting the probability of stroke using a patient dataset with highly imbalanced classes. The data was preprocessed by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and addressing class imbalance through upsampling and downsampling. 

Two machine learning models (logistic regression and Random ) were trained and evaluated using metrics suitable for imbalanced data, such as recall, precision and AUC-ROC.
